# gcrawler

GCrawler is a Python bot that uses its own Google Custom Search Engine to crawl the web for search results using the Google Search API.
<br>

To use this bot you need to install two dependencies using your terminal
<br>

$ pip/pip3 install google-api-python-client
<br>
$ pip/pip3 install pandas

<br>
<br>

In the script remember to replace 'my_api_key' with your 'Custom Search API key' and 'my_cse_id' with your 'Search engine ID'

<br>
<br>
<br>

Pro-tip:
If some dependencies don't work,
Run your dependency installations in a virtual environment.
