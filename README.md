# gcrawler

GCrawler is a Python bot that uses its own Google Custom Search Engine to crawl the web for search results using the Google Search API.

To use this bot you need to install two dependencies using your terminal

pip/pip3 install google-api-python-client
pip/pip3 install pandas

In the script remember to replace 'my_api_key' with your 'Custom Search API key' and 'my_cse_id' with your 'Search engine ID'

Pro-tip:
If some dependencies don't work,
Run your dependency installations in a virtual environment.
